Theoretically this makes sense in that if there are no absorbing molecules present then the absorbance should be zero. Realistically this doesn't happen. For example, analytical instruments don't behave ideally (i.e., there is always some background noise in signals) and blank substractions aren't perfect. So our best fit line will include an intercept. A calibration shouldn't go through the origin unless it demonstrated that the intercept is not statistically different than zero by calculating a t-ratio. For our spectrophotometric analysis the intercept will be statistically different than zero so we must include it.\n",
